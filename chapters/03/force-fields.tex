\chapter{Semi-empirical force fields}

\section{Introduction}
A protein system can be modelled using a force field, a description of the interactions between elements in the system.
A simulation needs a topology file which describes all of the interactions, the connecting information between atoms and the kind of force field that will be used.
To model protein systems semi-empirical force field are used.
The formula used in these kind of force fields are not rigorous: all the results from a simulation need to be validated through an experiment.

	\subsection{Potential energy surface}
	The state of any system can be described through a potential energy surface.
	The minima of the potential energy surface represents states in which the system will spend most of its time.
	The equilibrium state is found in the global minima of the surface.
	Lots of local minima are usually found on the surface and the system will jump between them during a simulation, with a frequency that depends on the deepness of the minima and the temperature of the environment.
	Statistical mechanics is necessary to compute the potential energy and the free energy surfaces at finite temperature, or when the jumping frequency is not zero.

		\subsubsection{Entropy}
		When dealing with these kind of computations entropy needs to be taken into account.
		To do so the conformational space, or the phase space, of the system needs to be explored so that compatible conformations for a certain condition can be found.


\section{Computing the potential energy between bonded atoms}
When computing the potential energy of an atom its interactions with the other with which it forms a chemical bond needs to be considered.
The chemical bond can assume different conformations, each with a different value of potential energy.
Because the objective is to consider conformational transitions, the system will be completely modelled using classical mechanics, so bonds are unbreakable.
The potential energy surface used to describe an unbreakable bond can be seen in figure \ref{fig:chem-bond}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{chem-bond}
	\caption{Typical potential energy of a chemical bond}
	\label{fig:chem-bond}
\end{figure}

	\subsection{Bond stretching}
	During bond stretching the distance of two bonded atoms changes.
	To model this process consider the typical potential energy for a chemical bond in figure \ref{fig:chem-bond}.
	Let $r_{eq}$ the distance for which the energy is minimal, or where the equilibrium is.
	Moving from it the energy increases.
	When close to the minimum the well can be assumed symmetric.
	Asymmetry arises far from the minimum: it can be seen how the left part is steeper.
	Using a Taylor expansion the potential energy is approximated at point $r$ by taking the value at the equilibrium and then constructing all the corrections:

	$$U(r)=U(r_{eq}) + \frac{dU}{dr}\biggr\vert_{r=r_{eq}}(r-r_{eq})+\frac{1}{2!}\frac{d^2U}{dr^2}\biggr\vert_{r=r_{eq}}(r-r_{eq})^2+\frac{1}{3!}\frac{d^3U}{dr^3}\biggr\vert_{r=r_{eq}}(r-r_{eq})^3+\cdots$$

	Considering this expansion:

	\begin{multicols}{2}
	  \begin{itemize}
	    \item The first term is the value at equilibrium multiplied by the distance.
			\item The second term is the correction for the second derivative and so on.
	  \end{itemize}
	\end{multicols}

	Now a number of assumptions can be made:

	\begin{multicols}{2}
	  \begin{itemize}
	    \item If the potential is symmetric the first term is $0$ as it happens near the equilibrium.
				This makes the first term negligible.
			\item If the minimum is shallow the third term is $0$ and happens near the equilibrium.
				This makes the third term negligible.
	  \end{itemize}
	\end{multicols}

	\begin{align*}
		U(r)&=U(r_{eq}) + \xcancel{\frac{dU}{dr}\biggr\vert_{r=r_{eq}}(r-r_{eq}})+\frac{1}{2!}\frac{d^2U}{dr^2}\biggr\vert_{r=r_{eq}}(r-r_{eq})^2+\xcancel{\frac{1}{3!}\frac{d^3U}{dr^3}\biggr\vert_{r=r_{eq}}(r-r_{eq})^3}+\cdots\\
	\end{align*}

	So that in the end the typical harmonic potential is obtained:

	$$U(r_{AB}) = \frac{1}{2}k_{AB}(r_{AB}-r_{AB,eq})^2$$

	Considering that:

	\begin{multicols}{2}
	  \begin{itemize}
			\item $k$ is related to $\frac{d^2 U}{dr^2}$.
			\item The distances and $k$ are unique for each couple of atoms.
				An important issue for these parameters is transferability: these type of parameters need to be computed for each type of force field.
	  \end{itemize}
	\end{multicols}

		\subsubsection{Anharmonic force constant}
		Considering that the shape is not completely symmetric the third order term can be re-inserted in the formula when necessary.
		This introduces an asymmetry in the system, or an anharmonic force constant:

		$$U(r_{AB}) = \frac{1}{2}[k_{AB}+k^{(3)}_{AB}(r_{AB}-r_{AB, eq})](r_{AB}-r_{AB, eq})^2$$

		\subsubsection{Quartic correction}
		Also the fourth order term can be inserted for better accuracy:

		$$U(r_{AB}) = \frac{1}{2}[k_{AB}+k^{(3)}_{AB}(r_{AB}-r_{AB, eq}) + k^{(4)}_{AB}(r_{AB}-r_{AB,eq})^2](r_{AB}-r_{AB, eq})^2$$

		\subsubsection{Morse potential}
		The Morse potential is used in implicit solvent simulation.
		The exponential allows to describe screen interactions that happen with the implicit solvent.
		This is more difficult to compute, but it is also useful for soft or coarse-grained systems.

		$$U(r_{AB}) = D_{AB}\left[1-e^{-\alpha_{AB}(r_{AB}-r_{AB,eq})^2}\right]$$

	\subsection{Valence angle bending}
	When an atom makes multiple bonds with different atom the angle between the bonds can fluctuate around an equilibrium value.
	These events are described as valence angle bending.
	A valence angle is represented in \ref{fig:valence-angle-bending}.

	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{valence-angle-bending}
		\caption{A valence angle}
		\label{fig:valence-angle-bending}
	\end{figure}

	In order to describe valence angle bending a Taylor expansion introducing an equilibrium angle is built.
	The first order term is not considered as it will be equal to $0$.
	Then the second introduces the harmonic potenital and the third for the anharmonic one, in principle also the quartic correction could be added.
	This formula is similar to the previous one but all the constant have to be described between each triplet of atoms:

	$$U(\theta_{ABC}) = \frac{1}{2}[k_{ABC}+k^{(3)}_{ABC}(\theta_{ABC}-\theta_{ABC,eq})+k^{(4)}_{ABC}(\theta_{ABC}-\theta_{ABC,eq})^2+\cdots](\theta_{ABC}-\theta_{ABC, eq})^2$$

		\subsubsection{Multiple minima}
		Another thing to consider when studying valence angle bending is that angles do not vary continuously: they wrap around at $\pi$ and $0$.
		This introduces a problem as the Taylor expansion cannot account for this event.

			\paragraph{Fourier expansion}
			To solve this problem the potential energy can be modelled thought a Fourier expansion.
			This operation introduces a periodic function that contains oscillations around a period, allowing to model any possible periodic potential, as the one for angles.

			\paragraph{Valence angle bending with a Fourier expansion}
			To parametrize the valence angle bending interaction a Fourier term is introduced, such that the terms are labelled with $j$.
			The amplitude, which multiplies each Fourier component decreases with $j$ and a cut-off on it is given, so to consider only low-frequency components.
			Now the potential energy for a valence angle bending interaction can be described by:

			$$U(\theta_{ABC}) = \sum\limits_{\{j\}_{ABC}}k^{fourier}_{j,ABC}[1+\cos(j\theta_{ABC}+\psi_j)]$$

			Where:

			\begin{multicols}{2}
			  \begin{itemize}
			    \item $\psi_j$ is the phase angle.
					\item The amplitude is computed as:

						$$k_{j, ABC}^{fourier} = \frac{2k^{harmonic}_{ABC}}{j^2}$$

			  \end{itemize}
			\end{multicols}

	\subsection{Torsions}
	Let $A, B, C$ and $D$ be $4$ atoms, bound according to $A->B->C->D$, like in figure \ref{fig:torsions}.
	Torsions describe the relative rotations of atoms $A$ and $D$ around the bond between $C$ and $D$.

	\begin{figure}[H]
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{torsions}
		\caption{An example of torsion}
		\label{fig:torsions}
	\end{figure}

	To model this movement the planes $ABC$ and $BCD$ are built and the angle $\omega$ between them is considered.
	$\omega$ will describe the torsion around the bond.
	The angle is computed as the angle between the vectors perpendicular to the planes.
	The potential is computed through a Fourier expansion because it is periodic:

	$$U(\omega_{ABCD}) = \frac{1}{2}\sum\limits_{\{j\}_{ABCD}}V_{j,ABCD}\left[1+(-1)^{j+1}\cos(j\omega_{ABCD}+\psi_{j,ABCD})\right]$$

	All the possible groups of $4$ atoms, considering permutations and repetitions need to be parametrized to describe this potential.

		\subsubsection{Improper torsions}
		Improper torsions are a particular type of torsion that happens when the four atoms $A, B, C$ and $D$ are bound according to $A->B->C$ and $B->D$, like in figure \ref{fig:improper-torsions}.

		\begin{figure}[H]
			\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{improper-torsions}
			\caption{An example of improper torsion}
			\label{fig:improper-torsions}
		\end{figure}

		$B$ can be in the same plane of $A, C, D$ or it can pop out.
		In this case two planes are built, usually $ABC$ and $BCD$ and the angle $\omega$ between them is considered.
		The potential will describe the energy of the angle.
		The angle can be computed as the out of plane angle $OOP$, obtaining the equation for the plane $ACD$ and computing how much $B$ is out of that plane.
		The potential is again described through a Fourier expansion:

		$$U(\omega_{ABCD}) = \frac{1}{2}\sum\limits_{\{j\}_{ABCD}}V_{j,ABCD}[1+(-1)^{j+1}\cos(j\omega_{ABCD}+\psi_{j,ABCD})]$$

		To parameterize this potential all possible groups of an atom connected with $3$ others need to be considered.
		The $sp^2$ hybridization constraints all the atoms in a plane.

\section{Non bonded interactions}

	\subsection{Van der Waals interactions}
	Van der Waals interactions happen whenever two atoms come close to one another without any chemical bond connecting them.
	This interaction is called dispersion interaction and depends on the interaction between the electron clouds that become correlated.
	Even if electrons are not shared the fluctuation of the electron clouds of an atom will interact with the one of an atom close to it.
	Looking at the interaction energy in figure \ref{fig:van-der-waals}.
	This can be computed and described by an attraction that goes with the $6$th power of the distance.
	This interaction is the Van der Waals interaction.
	This attraction is an attractive force and will decrease with the $6$th power of the distance.
	Also a repulsion happen.
	The repulsion is due to the occupancy of the possible orbitals.
	The problem is then Pauli's exclusion principle: whenever two atoms come close the energy level becomes occupied and the atoms cannot come to close to one another.
	This is difficult to compute but it can be modelled assuming that is a repulsion with an hard limit.
	The energy becomes very high when the distance becomes less than the equilibrium.
	If the attraction is modelled with the $6$th power this interaction can be modelled by the $12$th power.
	In this case if the distance is too small the energy becomes very high.

	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{van-der-waals}
		\caption{Energy of a Van der Waals interaction}
		\label{fig:van-der-waals}
	\end{figure}

		\subsection{Lennard-Jones potential}
		The discussion done above lead to the introduction of the Lennard-Jones potential.
		This models Van der Waals interaction using the $6$th power for the dispersion and the repulsion due to Pauli's exclusion principle is modelled by the $12$th power.
		This power is used to make the computation cheap and has no physical basis.
		In this way this formula is obtained:

		\begin{align*}
			U_(r_{AB}) &= \frac{a_{AB}}{r^{12}_{AB}}-\frac{b_{AB}}{r^6_{AB}}=\\
								 &= 4\epsilon_{AB}\biggl[\biggl(\frac{\sigma_{AB}}{r_{AB}}\biggr)^{12}-\biggl(\frac{\sigma_{AB}}{r_{AB}}\biggr)^6\biggr]
		\end{align*}

		And the distance with minimum energy or equilibrium.

		$$r^*_{AB} = 2^{\frac{1}{6}}\sigma_{AB}$$

		And it can be seen how it is a multiple of $\sigma_{AB}$ or the Van der Waals radius, the distance where the value of the energy if exactly equal to $0$.
		$-\epsilon$ is the minimum value of the energy (equilibrium).
		In this way dispersion and repulsion of any couple of atoms can be described.
		A value of $\sigma_{AB}$ have to be introduced for any couple of atom type.

		\subsection{Morse potential}
		The Morse potential and the Hill potential can be used with coarse grained system.
		Dealing only with all-atom simulation these will be rarely used.
		Working in soft-matter simulation these could be used.
		These have the same features of the Lennard-Jones potential.

		$$U(r_{AB}) = D_{AB}[1-e^{-a_{AB}(r_{AB}-r_{AB,eq})^2}]$$

		\subsection{Hill potential}

		$$U(r_{AB}) = \epsilon_{AB}\biggl[\frac{6}{\beta_{AB}-6}e^{\beta_{AB}\frac{1-r_{AB}}{r^*_{AB}}}-\frac{\beta_{AB}}{\beta_{AB}-6}\biggl(\frac{r^*_{AB}}{r_{AB}}\biggr)^6\biggr]$$

		In some force fields $1$-$4$ interactions (successive bonds atoms can be numbered) are reduced by a scaled factor.
		Atom $1$ and $4$ are close to each other in a proper torsion but attraction and repulsion has been already described by the torsion, so in some force fields, the torsions takes into account the proximity of those atoms.
		So the Van der Waals interactions are excluded for $1$-$4$ atoms as they are already been described by the torsion interaction.


\section{Electrostatic interactions}
Electrostatic interactions, together with Van der Waals one are two kind of non-bonded interactions.
Moreover interactions between molecules that might be charged or that can be polar.
The distribution of charges need to be described.
In principle a multiple expansion should be performed: the cloud of positive and negative charges should be described by using given shapes of the clouds.
And each molecule should be described and all the molecules should be described by these multiple expansion and they should be multiplied as matrix.

$$U_{AB} = \vec{M}^{(A)}V^{(B)}$$

Now, summing over all molecules:

$$U_{AB} = \sum\limits_{A}\sum\limits_{B>A}\vec{M}^{(A)}\vec{V}^{(B)}$$

This is a very costly procedure but accurate.

	\subsection{Point like charges}
	To make the computation easier molecules are represented as point-like partial charges.
	In a chemical molecule partial charges can be assumed that are point-like and are located on the atom.
	The electron cloud is displaced toward the negative cloud and away from the positive one.
	In this way the distribution of charges can be represented by number placed on each atom.
	Once this is done an electric charge is associated with each bead and the Coulomb interaction is used:

	$$U_{AB} = \frac{q_Aq_B}{\epsilon_{AB}r_{AB}}$$

	The dielectric constant is $1$ in the case of explicit solvent, but in the case of the implicit one it will be the one of the solvent.

	\subsection{Dipolar interactions}
	Dipolar interaction can be included when considering electrostatic forces.
	These formulae are mostly used in corse grained models.
	Because in that case the approximation of single charges on a bead cannot be made and dipoles are considered.
	In this case a functional form and the parameters need to be included.
	$\mu$ is the dipole of two molecules.
	Then there is the dielectric constant, the cube of the distance and the cosine term represent the orientation of the two dipoles.

	$$U_{AB/CD} = \frac{\mu_{AB}\mu_{CD}}{\epsilon_{AB/CD}r^3_{AB/CD}}(\cos\chi_{AB/CD}-3\cos\alpha_{AB}\cos\alpha_{CD})$$

	\begin{figure}[H]
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{dipolar-interactions}
		\caption{An example of a dipolar interaction}
		\label{fig:dipolar-interactions}
	\end{figure}

	\subsection{Dielectric constants}

	$$U_{AB} = \frac{q_Aq_B}{\epsilon_{AB}r_{AB}}$$

	The dielectric constant can assume different values.
	If they are connected by a chemical bond or if there is a valence angle between the atoms the dielectric constant is $\infty$ and the interaction is not computed as it is already taken into account by other terms.
	In several force field a factor of $2$ is added for $1$-$4$ interaction.
	In the last case the value depend on the force field.

	$$\epsilon_{AB} = \begin{cases}\infty&\text{ if }A\land B\text{are 1,2- or 1,3-related}\\3.0&\text{ if }A\land B\text{are 1,4-related}\\1.5&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$

\section{Cross terms}
There are also cross terms: angle bending and bond stretching and other movement are not independent: all the possible degrees of freedom should be considered together.
This is done only by some force fields.

\begin{align*}
	U(\vec{q}) = &U(\vec{q}_{eq}) + \sum\limits_{i=1}^{3N-6}(q_i-q_{i,eq})\frac{\partial U}{\partial q_i}\biggr\vert_{\vec{q}=\vec{q}_{eq}} + \\
							 &+\frac{1}{2!}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{3N-6}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{3N-6}(q_i-q_{i.eq})(q_j-q_{j,eq})\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial q_i\partial q_j}\biggr\vert_{\vec{q}=\vec{q}_{eq}} +\\
							 &=\frac{1}{3!}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{3N-6}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{3N-6}\sum\limits_{k=1}^{3N-6}(q_i-q_{i,eq})(q_j-q_{j.eq})(q_k-q_{k,eq})\frac{\partial^3 U}{\partial q_i\partial q_j\partial q_k}\biggr\vert_{\vec{q}=\vec{q}_{eq}} + \cdots
\end{align*}

This is done by starting from a Lagrangian describing all the interaction and compute all the terms.
In practice everything is done without considering them.

$$U(r_{AB}, \theta_{ABC}) = \frac{1}{2}k_{AB,ACB}(r_{AB}-r_{AB, eq})(\theta_{ABC}-\theta_{ABC, eq})$$

\section{Parametrization}
All the interactions need a large set of parameters.
The number of parameters increases with the number of atoms $N$:

$$p = N + (N-1)+(N-2)+\cdots = N\frac{N+1}{2}$$

In order to obtain these parameters data from experiments are used.
This is the reason why the force-field are semi-empirical.
To do so the results of the experiments are compared from the results of simulations.
Then the penalty function:

$$Z = \biggl[\sum\limits_{i}^{observables}\sum\limits_{j}^{occurrences}\frac{(calc_{i,j}-expt_{i,j})^2}{w_i^2}\biggr]^{\frac{1}{2}}$$

Sums over all the data from all the observables and all possibilities.
Then all the observable are measured and are compared with the simulation result.
Then the square is taken to not compensate the error and it is divided by a weight.
This penalty function is minimized changing the parameters until some reasonable compromise is obtained.
The more experimental data is obtained the more accurate the description.
This is the reason for the constant update of the force fields.
A way to reduce the number of parameters is to employ a strategy so that a parameter to each atom is computed and then it is computed the interaction between two atoms:

\begin{align*}
	\sigma_{AB} &= \sigma_A+\sigma_B\\
	\epsilon_{AB} &= (\epsilon_A\epsilon_B)^{\frac{1}{2}}
\end{align*}

\section{Force field energies}
In molecules the ground state of one molecule is different from the ground state of another.
Molecules can have different states and when they come in contact the ground state have to be taken into account.
So parametrizing the force field is very complicated.

	\subsection{Geometry optimization}
	Once the force fields are obtained some atoms can be missing from the model and have to be included by hand.
	Sometimes it may happen that two atoms are too close to each other and by using the potential energy it can be high leading to high forces, causing the atom that experience them to be kicked out.
	So the simulation will explode.
	In order to avoid this a geometry optimization is done to obtain the parameters or to minimize so to avoid high forces values at the start of a simulation.
	When starting a simulation the system will be at an energy value which be greater than the equilibrium.
	The gradient of the energy is computed and the system is moved toward the minimum energy.
	The derivative need to be computed of $U$ with respect to each component in the system.

	$$\vec{g}(\vec{q}) = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial U}{\partial q_1} \\ \frac{\partial U}{\partial q_2} \\ \vdots \\ \frac{\partial U}{\partial q_n}\end{bmatrix}$$

	Such that the cost reaches a global minimum $J_{min}(\vec{w})$.

	\subsection{Derivative of the potential function}
	First the derivatives need to be computed.
	All the potentials are given in term of the mutual distance of two atoms.
	So, considering $x$ the coordinates of a point:

	$$\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_A} = \sum\limits_{i\in A}\frac{\partial U}{\partial r_{Ai}}\frac{\partial r_{Ai}}{\partial x_A}$$

	Taking the derivative of this:

	$$U(r_{AB}) = \frac{1}{2}[k_{AB}+k_{AB}^{(3)}(r_{AB}-r_{AB, eq}) + k_{AB}^{(4)}(r_{AB}-r_{AB, eq})^2](r_{AB}-r_{AB,eq})^2$$

	With respect to the distance:

	$$\frac{\partial U}{\partial r_{Ai}} = \frac{1}{2}[2k_{Ai}+3k_{Ai}^{(3)}r_{Ai}-r_{Ai, eq}) + 4k^{(4)}_{Ai}(r_{Ai}-r_{Ai, eq})^2](r_{Ai}-r_{Ai, eq})$$

	In order to take the derivative with respect to $r$ the derivative with to $x$ needs to be known:

	$$\frac{\partial r_{Ai}}{\partial x_A} = \frac{x_A-x_i}{\sqrt{(x_A-x_i)^2+(y_A-y_i)^2+(z_A-z_i)^2}}$$

	Then this formula can plugged in according to the chain rule.

		\subsubsection{Newton-Raphson}
		To perform the minimization as an iterative procedure, the Newton-Raphson to find a local minimum is employed.
		Here $(n)$ refers to the iteration.
		This allow to obtain iteration $k+1$ starting from iteration $k$ and is a Taylor expansion of coordinates at iteration $k$:

		$$U(\vec{q}^{(k+1)}) = U(\vec{q}^{(k)}) + (\vec{q}^{(k+1)} -\vec{q}^{(k)})\vec{g}^{(k)} + \frac{1}{2}(\vec{q}^{(k+1)}-\vec{q}^{(k)})H^{(k)}(\vec{q}^{(k+1)}-\vec{q}^{(k)})$$

		This is done to find eventually the coordinates at iteration $k+1$ which are unknown.
		Where $H$ is the Hessian matrix built:

		$$H_{ij}^{(k)} = \frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial q_i\partial q_j}\biggr\vert_{\vec{q}=\vec{q}^{(k)}}$$

		Everything is computed from a Taylor expansion from coordinates at iteration $k$.
		And:

		$$\frac{\partial U(\vec{q}^{(k+1)})}{\partial q_i^{(k+1)}} = \frac{\partial \vec{q}^{(k+1)}}{\partial q_i^{(k+1)}}\vec{g}^{(k)}+ \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial \vec{q}^{(k+1)}}{\partial q_i^{(k+1)}}H^{(k)}(\vec{q}^{(k+1)}-\vec{q}^{(k)})+\frac{1}{2}(\vec{q}^{(k+1)}-\vec{q}^{(k)})H^{(k)}\frac{\partial \vec{q}^{(k+1)}}{\partial q_i^{(k+1)}}$$

		This formula tells that:

		$$\vec{g}_i^{(k+1)} = \vec{g}_i^{(k)} + [H^{(k)}(\vec{q}^{(k+1)}-\vec{q}^{(k)})]_i$$

		Where at the end it should be obtained a stationary condition, where the system does not change after an iteration:

		$$\vec{0} = \vec{g}^{(k)} + H^{(k)}(\vec{q}^{(k+1)}-\vec{q}^{(k)})\Rightarrow \vec{q}^{(k+1)} = \vec{q}^{(k)} - [H^{(k)}]^{-1}\vec{g}^{(k)}$$

		Because the starting point was a Taylor expansion the new coordinates will not be exact, and so other iterations will be needed.
		This process is repeated until convergence is reached, choosing a given tolerance on $\vec{0}$.

	\subsection{Types of force fields}
	Force fields can be categorized as:

	\begin{multicols}{2}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item All atoms: one atom corresponds to one bead.
			\item More atoms: more atoms correspond to one bead.
			\item Corse grained: groups of atoms correspond to one bead.
			\item Polarizzarle force fields: point charges are variables.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{multicols}

	As a golden rule parameters from different force fields should never be mixed.
