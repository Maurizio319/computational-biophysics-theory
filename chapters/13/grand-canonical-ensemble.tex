\chapter{The grand canonical ensemble}

\section{Introduction}
The Gran Canonical (GC) ensemble comes in handy when the number of molecules cannot be kept fixed during the simulation.
This is one of the main differences between MD and MC approaches: it is not possible to perform MD simulations with varying number of molecules.

	\subsection{Euler's theorem}
	Homogeneous function $f(x_1, \dots, x_N)$ of degree $n$ in $x_1, \dots, x_k$:

	$$f(\lambda x_1, \dots, \lambda x_k, x_{k+1}, \dots, x_N) = \lambda^n f(x_1, \dots, x_k, \dots, x_N)$$

	This property states that if each variable $(x_1, ... x_k)$ is increased by a certain value $\lambda$, then the net result is that the value of the function is increased by a factor $\lambda^n$.
	An example of this property can be showed by the homogeneous function $f(x) = x^2$, $f(x, y, z) = xy^2+z^3$.
	The degree is $3$ and each variable $(x, y, z)$ is increased by a factor $\lambda$.
	Taking the derivative:

	$$\frac{d}{d\lambda} f(\lambda x_1, \dots, \lambda x_k, \dots, x_N) = n\lambda^{n-1}f(x_1, \dots, x_k,\dots, x_N)$$

	If the partial derivative is calculated with respect to each variable and then the derivative of the variable itself with respect to $\lambda$ is obtained:

	$$\frac{d}{d\lambda}f(\lambda x_1, \dots, \lambda x_k, \dots, x_N) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^k\frac{\partial f(x_1, \dots, x_k, \dots, x_N)}{\partial x_i}x_i$$

	Meaning that the two quantities are equal and the following property (for an homogeneous function) can be obtained:

	$$\lambda = 1 \Rightarrow \sum\limits_{i=1}^k\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}x_i = nf(x_1, \dots, x_N)$$

	\subsection{Applications}
	Euler's theorem has important consequences in thermodynamics, as it means that all of the thermodynamics function can be expressed in terms of other parameters, and it is valid for every substance.
	Applying Euler's theorem to the internal energy $U$:

	$$U(\lambda N, \lambda V, \lambda S) = \lambda U(N, V, S)\Rightarrow U(N, V, S) = \frac{\partial U}{\partial N}N + \frac{\partial U}{\partial V}V_\frac{\partial U}{\partial S}S = \mu N - PV + TS$$

	Each of the above partial derivatives are easily calculated through Maxwell square.
	Applying the theorem to Helmholtz free energy:

	$$A(\lambda N, \lambda V, T) = \lambda A(N, V, T) \Rightarrow A(N, V, T) = \frac{\partial A}{\partial N}N + \frac{\partial A}{\partial V}V = \mu N - PV$$

	The difference here is that the extensive quantities are $N$ and $V$, while $T$ is an intensive quantity.
	The function is not homogeneous in $T$, e.g. if T is increased by a factor $\lambda$ the whole function is not increased.
	Applying it now to the enthalpy:

	$$H(\lambda N, \lambda S, P) = \lambda H(N, S, P)\Rightarrow H(N, S, P) = \frac{\partial H}{\partial N}N+\frac{\partial H}{\partial N}N+\frac{\partial H}{\partial S}S = \mu N+TS$$

	Like for $A$, the enthalpy is a homogeneous function for two of its variables, but not for $P$.
	Finally, considering Gibbs free energy:

	$$G(\lambda N, P, T) = \lambda G(N, P, T)\Rightarrow G(N, P, T) = \frac{\partial G}{\partial N}N= \mu N$$

	It has only one dependency on an extensive quantity: the number of particles.
	The fact that the chemical potential $\mu$ is exactly $G$ divided by $N$, as demonstrated in the previous chapter can be obtained.

	\subsection{Legendre transform of A}
	Applying the same reasoning that was applied to the isobaric ensembles:

	$$\tilde{f}(s) = f(x(s))-sx(s)\qquad s = f'(x)$$

	The Legendre transform will not be applied in terms of volume, but instead in terms of its derivative with respect to the number of molecules:

	\begin{align*}
		\tilde{A}\biggl(\frac{\partial A}{\partial N}, V, T\biggr) &= A(N(\mu), V, T)-\biggl(\frac{\partial A}{\partial N}\biggr)_{N, V}N\biggl(\frac{\partial A}{\partial N}, V, T\biggr) = \\
																															 &=A(N(\mu), V, T) - \mu N = \mu N - PV - \mu N = -PV
	\end{align*}

	From the results obtained before, the result of the Legendre transform is simply $-PV$.
	Now the infinitesimal variation of the transformed $A$ has to be computed:

	$$d\tilde{A} = dA - Nd \mu -\mu dN = -PdV - SdT + \mu dN -Nd\mu - \mu dN$$

	$$d\tilde{A} = -PdV - SdT - Nd\mu$$

	$$\tilde{A}(\mu, \lambda V, T) = \lambda\tilde{A}(\mu, V, T)\Rightarrow \tilde{A}(\mu, V, T) = \frac{\partial \tilde{A}}{\partial V}V = -PV$$

	Notice that $\tilde{A}$ depends on only one extensive variable ($V$), so Euler's theorem can be applied again.


\section{Grand canonical ensemble}
As for the previous ensembles, the analysis starts from the definition of the main variables of the equations and in figure \ref{fig:grand} the two systems are depicted.

\begin{figure}[H]
\center
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{grand.png}
\caption{Two systems in contact with a common thermal reservoir at temperature $T$. System $1$ has $N_1$ particles in a volume $V_1$ ; system 2 has $N_2$ particles in a volume $V_2$. The dashed lines indicate that systems $1$ and $2$ can exchange particles.}
\label{fig:grand}
\end{figure}

\begin{multicols}{2}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $E = E_1 + E_2\quad E_2\gg E_1$.
		\item $N = N_1 + N_2\quad N_2\gg N_1$.
		\item $V = V_1 + V_2\quad V_2\gg V_1$.
		\item $\mathcal{H}(x, N) = \mathcal{H}_1(x_1, N_1) + \mathcal{H}_2(x_2, N_2)$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

The partition function is the same as a canonical ensemble when the exchange of molecules between the two systems is stopped:

$$Q(N, V, T) = \frac{1}{N!h^{3N}}\int dx_1\int dx_2e^{-\beta[\mathcal{H}_1(x_1) + \mathcal{H}_2(x_2)]}$$

At fixed $N_1$ and $N_2$, not allowing any other exchange of particles, then the partition function is:

$$Q(N, V, T) = \frac{N_1!N_2!}{N!}\frac{1}{N_1!h^{3N_1}}\int dx_1 e^{-\beta\mathcal{H}_1(x_1)}\frac{1}{N_2!h^{3N_2}}\int dx_2^{-\beta\mathcal{H}_2(x_2)} = \frac{N_1!N_2!}{N!}Q_1(N_1, V_1, T)Q_2(N_2, V_2, T)$$

With a varying particle numbers:

$$Q(N, V, T) = \sum\limits_{N_1=0}^Ng(N_1, N-N_1)\frac{N_1!(N-N_1)!}{N!}Q_1(N_1, V_1, T)Q_2(N-N_1, V-V_1, T)$$

The factor $g$ is a combinatorial (or degeneracy) factor, and indicates in how many ways the particles can be divided in one box and the other, or in how many ways there are $N_1$ particles in system $1$ and $N_2$ particles in system $2$.
It is defined as:
$$g(N_1, N-N_1) = \frac{N!}{N_1!(N-N_1)!}$$

\begin{multicols}{3}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $N_1 = 0\Rightarrow g(0, N) = 1$.
		\item $N_1 = 1\Rightarrow g(1, N-1) = N$.
		\item $N_1 = 2\Rightarrow g(2, N-2) = \frac{N(N-1)}{2}$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

So the total partition function is defined as:

$$Q(N, V, T) = \sum\limits_{N_1=0}^NQ_1(N_1, V_1, T)Q_2(N-N_1, V-V_1, T)$$

However for the full system, considered as a canonical ensemble, the partition function is known:

$$f(x, N) = \frac{e^{-\beta\mathcal{H}(x, N)}}{N!h^{3N}Q(N, V, T)}\Rightarrow dxf(x, N) = 1$$

And the phase space distribution of system $1$: $\sum\limits_{N_1=0}^{N}\int dx_1f(x_1, N_1) = 1$.

\begin{align*}
	f(x_1, N_1) &=\biggl(\frac{e^{-\beta\mathcal{H}_1(x_1, N_1)}}{Q(N, V, T)N_1!h^{3N_1}}\biggr)\frac{1}{(N-N_1)!h^{3(N-N_1)}}\int dx_2e^{-\beta\mathcal{H}_2(x_2, N-N_1)} = \\
							&= \frac{Q_2(N-N_1, V-V_1, T)}{Q(N, V, T)}\frac{1}{N_1!h^{3N_1}}e^{-\beta\mathcal{H}_1(x_1, N_1)}
\end{align*}

$$\frac{Q_2(N-N_1, V-V_1, T)}{Q(N, V, T)} = e^{-\beta[A(N-N_1, V-V_1, T) - A(N, V, T)]}$$

$$A(N-N_1, V-V_1, T)\approx A(N, V, T) -\frac{\partial A}{\partial N}N_1-\frac{\partial A}{\partial V}V_1 = A(N, V, T)-\mu N_1 + PV_1$$


	\subsection{Grand partition function}

	The phase-space distribution is:

	$$f(x_1, N_1) = \frac{1}{N_1!h^{3N_1}}e^{\beta\mu N_1}e^{-\beta PV_1}e^{\beta\mathcal{H}_1(x_1, N_1)}$$

	In the equation there's no dependence on $N_2$ and the subscript $1$ can be dropped :

	$$f(x, N) = \frac{1}{N!h^{3N}}e^{\beta\mu N}e^{-\beta PV}e^{\beta\mathcal{H}(x, N)}$$

	Taking exactly the normalization condition:

	$$\sum\limits_{N=0}^{\infty}\int dxf(x, N) = \sum\limits_{N=0}^{\infty}e^{-\beta PV}\frac{1}{N!h^{3N}}e^{\beta\mu N}\int dxe^{-\beta\mathcal{H}(x, N)} = 1$$

	The same function as in the canonical ensemble is obtained, and the partition function of the grand-canonical ensemble is $e^{\beta PV}$, as supposed by Euler's theorem.

	$$\sum\limits_{N+0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{N!h^{eN }}e^{\beta\mu N}\int dxe^{-\beta\mathcal{H}(x, N)} = e^{\beta PV}$$

	Now the equation of state of the system can be written:

	$$\mathcal{E}(\mu, V, T) = \sum\limits_{N=0}^{\infty}e^{\beta\mu N}\frac{1}{N!h^{3N}}\int dxe^{-\beta\mathcal{H}(x, N)} = \sum\limits_{N=0}^{\infty}e^{\beta\mu N}Q(N, V, T) = e^{\beta PV}$$

	$$\frac{PV}{kT} = \ln\mathcal{E}(\mu, V, T)$$

	Moreover the average of the particles can be computed:

	$$\langle N\rangle = \frac{1}{\mathcal{E}(\mu, V, T)}\sum\limits_{N=0}Ne^{\beta\mu N}Q(N, V, T) = kT\biggl(\frac{\partial}{\partial\mu}\ln\mathcal{E}(\mu, V, T)\biggr)_{V, T}$$

	Including the fugacity:

	$$z = e^{\beta\mu}$$

	The grand canonical partition function can be written down in an easier way to remember:

	$$\mathcal{E}(z, V, T) = \sum\limits_{N=0}^{\infty}z^NQ(N, V, T)$$

	This time it is not even necessary to write down the derivatives, as the equation of state simply derives from its definition.
	However, the above equation is not very easy to deal with, as it is a function of the chemical potential of the fugacity, the volume and the temperature, and it is not the usual way in which the equation of state is written.
	The derivative of $z$ with respect to $\mu$ returns the average number of molecules.

	$$\frac{\partial}{\partial\mu} = \frac{\partial z}{\partial\mu}\frac{\partial}{\partial z} = \beta z\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\Rightarrow\langle N\rangle = z\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\ln\mathcal{E}(z, V, T)$$

	The quantity $\langle N\rangle$ is the relation between the chemical potential (or grand-canonical partition function) and the number of molecules.

	\subsection{Ideal gas}
	Applying the grand canonical equation to an ideal gas, the canonical partition function will be:

	$$Q(N, V, T) = \frac{1}{N!h^{3N}}V^N\biggl[\int dp \, e^{-\beta\frac{p^2}{2m}}\biggr]^{3N} = \frac{1}{N!}\biggl[V\biggl(\frac{2\pi m}{\beta h^2}\biggr)^{\frac{3}{2}}\biggr]^{N} = \frac{1}{N!}\biggl(\frac{V}{\lambda^3}\biggr)^N$$

	The term $(\frac{2\pi m}{\beta h^2}\biggr)^{\frac{3}{2}}$ has the dimension of a length to the power of $-3$, and it is called the \textbf{thermal wave length}, and is is indicated with $\lambda$.

	Performing the sum of the series to obtain the grand canonical partition function:

	$$\mathcal{E}(z, V, T) = \sum\limits_{N=0}^{\infty}z^N\frac{1}{N!}\biggl(\frac{V}{\lambda^3}\biggr)^{N} = \sum\limits_{N=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{N!}\biggl(\frac{zV}{\lambda^3}\biggr)^{N} = e^{\frac{zV}{\lambda^3}}$$

	Notice that also this time it is written in terms of the fugacity.
	Again, this form of the equation is hard to work with, so the average of the number of particles can be computed by taking the logarithm of the partition function and multiplying it for the derivative of the fugacity:

	$$\langle N\rangle = z\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\ln\mathcal{E}(z, V, T) = V\frac{z}{\lambda^3}\Rightarrow z = \frac{\langle N\rangle\lambda^3}{V}$$

	Meaning that the equation of state can be written as:

	$$\frac{PV}{kT} = \ln\mathcal{E}(z, V, T) = \frac{V_z}{\lambda^3}= \langle N\rangle$$

	It is easy to recognize the usual equation of state for an ideal gas, proving that this procedure works, as it yields the exact result for the ideal gas.

\section{Particle number fluctuations}
The grand canonical ensembles are extremely important in statistical mechanics, as they allow for easier calculations with respect to the canoncial or microcanonical ensembles.
The fact that the GC ensemble provides for a sum over a series makes the calculations easier, specifically in quantum statistical mechanics.
However, when in the GC ensemble, the net thermodynamics should not change.
In other words, the GC ensemble should be completely equivalent to the canonical one, in the sense that the thermodyanmics results obtained must be the same.
The difference between the two is the number of particles.
The fluctuations in the particle number has to be quantified: if they're too big, we could run into problems.
The particle number fluctuations are defined as:

$$\Delta N = \sqrt{\langle N^2\rangle-\langle N\rangle^2}$$

Defining them in terms of thermodynamics derivatives:

\begin{align*}
	z\frac{\partial}{\partial z}z\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\ln\mathcal{E}(z, V, T) &= z\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\frac{1}{\mathcal{E}}z\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\sum\limits_{N=0}^{\infty}z^NQ(N, V, T) = z\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\frac{1}{\mathcal{E}}\sum\limits_{N=0}^{\infty}Nz^N Q(N, V, T)=\\
																																									&=\frac{1}{\mathcal{E}}\sum\limits_{N=0}^{\infty}N^2z^NQ(N, V, T)-\frac{1}{\mathcal{E}^2}\biggl[\sum\limits_{N=0}^{\infty}Nz^NQ(N, V, T)\biggr]^2 = \langle N^2\rangle - \langle N\rangle^2
\end{align*}

The double derivative $z\frac{\partial}{\partial z}z\frac{\partial}{\partial z}$ is exactly equal to the average number of particles.
By the definition of fugacity:

$$kT\frac{\partial}{\partial\mu} = z\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\Rightarrow\Delta N^2 = (kT)^2\frac{\partial^2}{\partial\mu^2}\ln\mathcal{E}(\mu, V, T) = (kT)^2\frac{\partial^2}{\partial\mu^2}\frac{PV}{kT} = kTV\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial\mu^2}$$

The result obtained is:

$$\Delta N^2 = kTV\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial \mu^2}$$

But in order to get to something measurable other calculations have to be performed.
First of all, considering an "intensive Helmholtz free energy", this can be computed by dividing from the extensive Helmholtz free energy the number of particles and expressing it with intensive quantities:

$$a(v, T) = \frac{1}{N}A\biggl(N, \frac{V}{N}, T\biggr) \Rightarrow \mu = \frac{\partial A}{\partial N} = a(v, T) + N\frac{\partial a}{\partial v}{\partial v}{\partial N} = a(v, T) - V\frac{\partial a}{\partial v}$$

Where $v$ is the specific volume.
The pressure can be expressed in terms of the intensive Helmholtz:

$$P = -\biggl(\frac{\partial A}{\partial V}\biggr)_{N, T} = -N\frac{\partial a}{\partial v}\frac{\partial v}{\partial V} = -\frac{\partial a}{\partial v}\qquad\frac{\partial P}{\partial\mu} = \frac{\partial P}{\partial  v}{\partial v}{\partial\mu} = -\frac{\partial^2 a}{\partial v^2}\frac{\partial v}{\partial \mu}$$

Taking the derivative of the chemical potential with respect to the specific volume:

$$\frac{\partial\mu}{\partial v} = \frac{\partial a}{\partial v}-\frac{\partial a}{\partial v} - v \frac{\partial^2a}{\partial v^2}\Rightarrow \frac{\partial P}{\partial\mu} = \frac{1}{v}$$

Moreover, considering the second derivative:

$$\frac{\partial^2P}{\partial\mu^2} = -\frac{1}{v^2}\frac{\partial v}{\partial\mu} = \frac{1}{v^2}\biggl(v\frac{\partial^2 a}{\partial v^2}\biggr)^{-1} = -\frac{1}{v^3\frac{\partial P}{\partial v}}$$

$$\Delta N^2 = kTV\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial\mu^2}\qquad\qquad\frac{\partial^2 P}{\partial\mu^2} = -\frac{1}{v^3\frac{\partial P}{\partial v}}$$

Solving all the terms the thermal compressibility $\kappa_T$ is obtained, a measurable quantity:

$$\kappa_T = -\frac{1}{V}\frac{\partial V}{\partial P} = -\frac{1}{v}\frac{\partial v}{\partial P} = -\frac{1}{v\frac{\partial P}{\partial v}}\Rightarrow\Delta N^2 = \frac{kTV}{v^2}\kappa_T = \frac{\langle N\rangle kT}{v}\kappa_T$$

The term $ -\frac{1}{V}$ is added because when pressure is applied, the volume is expected to decrease.
This thermal compressibility determines how much the system is compressible with respect to pressure.
The fluctuation needs to be compared to the quantity of interest, obtaining the relative fluctuation:

$$\frac{\Delta N}{\langle N\rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{kT}{v\langle N\rangle}\kappa_T}\sim\frac{1}{\sqrt{\langle N\rangle}}$$

If the average number of particles is "high", which it usually is, being in the thermodynamic limit, then the fluctuation is negligible.
Meaning that every calculation performed in the GC ensemble is equal to the canonical one.
However, $k_T$ is not always a finite number, in particular during a phase transition, in which the thermal compressibility can be quite high.
In such a case, since the particles are moving from one phase to another, the only usable ensemble is one that takes into account the fact that the number of particles is not constant: the grand canonical ensemble.
