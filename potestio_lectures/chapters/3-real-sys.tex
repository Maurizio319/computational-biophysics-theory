\chapter{Real system analysis}

Real systems are analyzed performing experiments, in order to retrieve
experimental results.
They can be approximated through a model system, not replacing entirely the
system, over which it is possible to perform computational simulations. Those
give exact results for the model, whose analysis can be used to evaluate the
theory behind the construction of the models.
The exact values of the model can be then compared to the experimental results,
that allow to test the model.
